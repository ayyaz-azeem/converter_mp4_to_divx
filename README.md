use the python function such as:
convert_to_divx(input_folder, output_folder)

where 
input_folder = input_folder = "d:/coding/videos/"
output_folder = "d:/coding//divx_output"

input folder contains all mp4 videos
and then run this function, it should work. i have used this and the converted divx format video files plays on my Sony BX22 TV that was not playing mp4 files earlier.
